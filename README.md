# predicting-depression
Millions of people globally suffer from depression and it is a debilitating condition. At best it can be difficult for people to live their lives normally and happily, and at worst it leads to death by suicide. 

# GOAL:
Using machine learning and data that may otherwise be in a patient’s medical file, the goal is to predict who may have depression in a way that requires very little human participation from doctors and has lower time and money costs associated. The patients who are predicted to have depression could potentially be referred straight to mental health professionals in their area or who accept their health care coverage. The patient’s file could also be flagged to alert the medical staff the next time they have any kind of physician appointment to prompt doctors to start the conversation with patients. At the very least information and resources could be sent to patients directly to encourage them to take action on their own behalf.
